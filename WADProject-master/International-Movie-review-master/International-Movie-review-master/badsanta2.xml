          <details>Fueled by cheap whiskey, greed and hatred, Willie teams up once again with his angry little sidekick, Marcus, to knock off a Chicago charity on Christmas Eve. Along for the ride is 'the kid' - chubby and cheery Thurman Merman, a 250-pound ray of sunshine who brings out Willie's sliver of humanity.</details>
